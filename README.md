# Altium
## Prerequisites:
### * The file named "<ins>input.txt</ins>" must to exist in the root of the project, where .sln is located

## Notes
### * I wasn't able to reach the goal of processing 1GB/Min, but I did the best I could, I tried several different solutions and scenarios, but all without success.
### * Working with files is not an easy thing and can become complex.
### * I did unit tests only apart from <ins>Reading + Sorting + Output File</ins>, because the part of creating a file with random data was not the problem in itself.
